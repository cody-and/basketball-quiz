/*

What data type can I use to store all the questions, and the answers that go with them?
How can I present one set of question + answers on the screen one at a time, and move from to another?

How can I tell whether the user has clicked on the right answer?
How can I save high scores?

Test with just 1-2 questions


Set it up so that the display of the question and answers is the same, no matter which one is being displayed

Things to practice:
----------------------
1. Create DOM elements and display them on the screen 
2. Write a function that accepts an object, and displays the parts of the object on the screen
3. Write a function that detects when a button is clicked, and provides details about that button
